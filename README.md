Hello my name is Brian, I am taking this course as a step in the right direction for my final goal of studying cybersecurity. I believe cybersecurity, though demanding, is a broad enough topic to find something I like within it. Alongside this, they notoriously pay strongly with experience and expertise. I have older friends who are in the field who may not be the most excited about their work anymore but are given opportunities within their company to transfer to different departments or positions. (I.E. Moving to a more cloud-focused position)
